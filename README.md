# 🔧 DLX Assembly Projects – Scalar Multiplication & Caesar Cipher

This project showcases the use of **DLX assembly language** to implement two fundamental low-level routines:

- ✅ **Scalar multiplication** of a fixed-size vector  
- 🔐 **Caesar cipher** encryption on individual characters

## 🧠 Purpose

These exercises serve as practical demonstrations of essential **computer architecture concepts**, including:

- 📍 Register-based data manipulation  
- 🧮 Memory addressing and instruction-level operations  
- 🔁 Control flow and branching in assembly  

By translating algorithmic logic into low-level assembly code, this project helps build a deeper understanding of how basic data processing tasks are executed **close to the hardware**. It also promotes **disciplined, structured, and efficient programming practices** using a register-based instruction set.

## 📁 Contents

- `scalar_multiplication.dlx` – Multiplies each element of a fixed-size vector by a scalar
- `caesar_cipher.dlx` – Encrypts a single character using a Caesar shift (with configurable key)

## 🛠 Requirements

- DLX simulator/emulator or a DLX-specific tool
- Basic knowledge of assembly language concepts

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open your DLX simulator.
2. Load the desired `.dlx` file.
3. Run the program step-by-step or all at once to observe register/memory behavior.
4. Modify input values directly in memory/registers if needed.

## 📚 Educational Value

These implementations are ideal for students learning:

- Low-level algorithm implementation  
- Assembly-level debugging  
- Data representation in memory  
- How control structures translate into jumps and branches
