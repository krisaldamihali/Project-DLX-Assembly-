This project explores the application of DLX assembly language in implementing two essential low-level computational routines: 
scalar multiplication of a fixed-size vector and Caesar Cipher encryption 
on individual characters. These exercises serve as practical demonstrations of core computer architecture concepts, 
such as register-based data manipulation, memory addressing, instruction-level operations, and control flow in assembly. 
By translating abstract algorithmic logic into assembly code, the project aims to strengthen studentsâ€™ understanding 
of how simple data processing tasks are executed at the hardware-near level,
while also promoting disciplined and structured programming practices.
