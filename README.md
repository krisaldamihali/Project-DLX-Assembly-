ðŸ”§ DLX Assembly Projects â€“ Scalar Multiplication & Caesar Cipher
This project showcases the use of DLX assembly language to implement two fundamental low-level routines:

Scalar multiplication of a fixed-size vector

Caesar cipher encryption on individual characters

These practical exercises serve as hands-on demonstrations of key computer architecture concepts, including:

Register-based data manipulation

Memory addressing

Instruction-level arithmetic and logic

Branching and control flow

By translating algorithmic logic into assembly code, this project bridges the gap between high-level programming and hardware-level execution. It encourages a deeper understanding of how simple data processing tasks operate close to the machine, while also promoting disciplined, structured, and efficient programming practices in assembly.
